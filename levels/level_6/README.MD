<img src="../../assets/level_6/cover.png"  style="width: 100%;"/>

## Introduction

Congratulation for making it this far üëè
You've finished the foundational DAO-course, but keep in mind that this was only the beginning. The rest of the story belongs to you. Here are some suggestions for what to do next:

## Keep building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Whatever happens, keep building! There's only one way forward and that's the correct one.
We have a lot of ressources to help you on your journey. Here are some options:

### Option 1: Keep building the DAO üèóÔ∏è

Since you already have the foundation for a DAO. Why not keep building on top of it? Here are some suggestions:

- Add a frontend to the DAO.
- Improve the voting system to allow for more complex voting scenarios and long-term incentives.
- Create a treasury for the DAO and allow members to vote on how to spend the funds.
- Checkout the SNS framework and see how you can leverage it to raise funds and expand the DAO.

Here are some inspirations from previous students:

- [Motoko Bootcamp DAO](https://7xvuv-ziaaa-aaaak-qbvaq-cai.ic0.app/) - A DAO that controls a website and can be used to vote on the displayed content. Integrates with Internet Identity for authentication.
  -¬†[VODAO](https://7fpd5-oyaaa-aaaap-qa5kq-cai.ic0.app/) - A liquid democracy for the Internet Computer. Integrates with [Plug wallet](https://plugwallet.ooo/) for authentication and allow users to stake their tokens into neurons.
  -¬†[Discuss and Vote](https://5razo-nqaaa-aaaal-abw3a-cai.ic0.app/) - Another DAO with a sophisticated voting system and UI. Integrates with [Plug wallet](https://plugwallet.ooo/) for authentication.

### Option 2: Start a new project üöÄ

DAOs are not the only thing you can build with Motoko. You can build anything you want. Here are some suggestions:

- Start your own NFT collection.
- Build a decentralized social network.
- Build a decentralized exchange or a decentralized marketplace.
- Build a game.

There are no limits to what you can build. Only your imagination.
Here are some inspirations from previous students:

- [Motoko Art Wall](https://4bzoe-qiaaa-aaaal-qb4ca-cai.icp0.io/) - Draw simple pictures and post them on the Wall in the Internet Computer.
  -¬†[IC Batteries](https://wo25k-iqaaa-aaaan-qacda-cai.ic0.app/) - A fully customizable NFT collection.
- [Meme Wall](https://7bjjl-oaaaa-aaaap-abb2a-cai.icp0.io/) - A meme wall where anyone can post a meme and vote on the best ones.

### Option 3: Join a team and contribute to an existing project ü§ù

In the Motoko Bootcamp Discord, we have a section dedicated to builders. This is where you can find projects that are building in the open. Some of them are looking for contributors.

- Take a look the [Builders](https://discord.gg/YVTpqfaFwC) channel on Discord.

<p align="center"> <img src="../../assets/level_6/grant_program.png"  style="border: 1px solid black; width: 500px;"/> </p>

DFINITY operates a [developer grant program](https://dfinity.org/grants) to support those building on the Internet Computer platform. If you have an idea and want to develop on the IC, you can request funding, which can range from $5,000 to $100,000 (though first-time applicants are unlikely to receive $100,000). The grant program focuses on the following areas:

- Canister Development Kits (CDKs) & Agents.
- Developer Tooling (such as IDEs, debuggers, and logging libraries).
- Infrastructure (including oracles and asset bridges).
- Integrations & APIs (e.g., chat, email, maps).
- Apps & Open Internet Services.

Additionally, DFINITY has announced a specific $5 million program to support the intersection of AI and blockchain technology, as detailed [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dfinity-foundation-launches-5-million-grant-to-support-decentralized-ai-on-the-internet-computer-blockchain-301877065.html).

DFINITY also offers a grant program for [educational and community initiatives](https://dfinity.org/community-grants). If you have an idea for a hackathon, workshop, or other community event, you can apply for a grant to secure funding.

Note: Please make sure to mention that you were referred by the Motoko Bootcamp when applying for a grant. Additionally, we are available to assist you with your grant application.
